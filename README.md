Bachelor of Science from UW-Madison in physics, astronomy, and computer science, with a concentration in high energy physics experimental research. 

**Currently working on**: software engineer at Abbott, leading data-driven development to the Human Factors Engineering dept. with feature usage data obtained through log mining - using data to inform user interface enhancement of a very cluttered and complex software system used for intra-cardiac mapping and ablation procedures. 

üê≤ **Personal portfolio project**: I'm also working on a side project of mine is extracting data from over 2200 html files on the complete monster index for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition and putting into a proper "database" - really it's static site generation from a collection of HTML source files that act as a interfacable record, so hosting it is freeee (except for the domain name but that's cheap).
