Bachelor of Science in physics, astronomy, and computer science, with a concentration in high energy physics experimental research. 

🐲 **Personal portfolio project**: I'm also working on a side project: extracting data from over 2000 html files to create a complete monster index for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition and putting all the monsters into a proper "database" - really it's static site generation from a collection of HTML source files that act as a interfacable record, so hosting it is freeee (except for the domain name but that's cheap).
