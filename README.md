Hello there!

I am a recent graduate of University of Wisconsin-Madison with a degree in physics, astronomy, and computer science, with a particular interest in high energy physics research. 

I am in a constant state of not knowing enough and always learning new things, especially if there is a new way to spend more time automating something than be caught dead doing it by hand. 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: designing new tutorials for C++ tailored for physics students for the IRIS-HEP Fellowship. A side project of mine is extracting data from over 2000 html files on the complete monster index for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition and putting into a proper database. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: More about C++ that I would like to
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Any large HEP experiment, CERN pls hire me 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: Graduate school applications
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about dark matter!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email me about anything!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

<!-- - âš¡ Fun fact: Not so much a fun fact but a proverb I just came up with: you do not need to reinvent the wheel to get it to work, but the inventors of the wheel were likely unaware of the exact geometric priciples behind _why_ it works. (this being because the sliding frictional surfaces, the bearing and axel, travel a small fraction of the distance that would be traveled by just dragging the load, resulting in a fraction of work done.) The point of this is that in order to truly understand the truth behind mechanisms in our world it takes almost as much effort as reinventing them. -->
